# After tons of hassles with disrupted Ruby/Rails/RubyGems installations --
# http://is.gd/hvM9 -- I gave in and gave another Debian Ruby/Rails a try,
# that is Debian Lenny's Ruby. Currently -- that is just before release of
# Debian Lenny -- if not perfect, it looks usable. I hope backports.org will
# keep us up to date with Ruby/Rails/RubyGems once Lenny's released.
#
# To get this here Twitter bot up and running, additionally to the default
# Debian ruby package, you need the following:
#
# deb: ruby-dev => mkmf
# gem: twitter => core gem
#      echoe => fix rubygems

# Obviously, as you don't want  to be held legally responsible for any kind
# of abusive action taken through your bot account, you don't want to share
# your actual login data for the ~Twitter bot with the rest of us. Neither do
# I.
#    Hence, to the repository I check in false login data in the form of some
# yaml files, so everyone easily can get the idea of what format the yaml
# shall be in. On the other hand, I keep another set of yaml files that hold
# valid login data for the bots I am using for development.
#    As much as the next one I dislike software packages checked out somewhere
# else only to find them disrupt. Therefore, Prior to every update to the
# repository, I make sure the bot code refers to files that are actually
# there even if filled with invalid data -- the latter will be pointed out by
# mechanisms inside the bot, while the prior just leaves the inexperienced
# clueless: "What *are* these files, that error message is talking about?"
#    In the past, I eased the swap-in/swap-out process by having the another
# set of yaml files named just like those checked in to the repository, with
# the only exception that they are prepended with  a "my-".
#    Though, still the files names were hard-coded all around. This changes
# by now, collecting them all below.
#    Still the advice holds true: Copy the checked in/checked out credential
# files to some own ones, patch them to have valid credentials and make sure
# that the names of these valid files are assigned to
# VALID_TWITTER_CREDENTIALS__DO_NOT_CHECK_IN and
# VALID_IDENTICA_CREDENTIALS__DO_NOT_CHECK_IN respectively.
