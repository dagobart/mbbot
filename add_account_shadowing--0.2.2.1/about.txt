This set of libraries and one main program -- micro_blog_bot.rb -- aims at
simplifying automated response systems ("bots") for popular micro-blogging
services such as Twitter.com and Identi.ca.


Common Twitter bots written in Ruby are often just that, a bot aimed at
Twitter, not at any other compatible micro-blogging service. Also, those bots
often do barely any more but build atop a single functionality and use that.
Such as relaying RSS feeds to Twitter, i.e. to everyone who's following those
bots.

On the other hand, this here framework aims at providing developers with an
easy to use, simple to customize framework for fully interactive chat bots
delivering services to their bots' followers. This framework can be used with
every alternative Twitter-compatible platform, such as Identica, right from
the first version on that's to be checked in to Sourceforge.
