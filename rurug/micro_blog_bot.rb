  # * On identi.ca, from its creation on, the bot account had itself as
  #   friend and follower. Also, whatever it posts -- e.g. replies to other
  #   users' requests -- the bot sees as replies to itself. This holds true
  #   only for identi.ca. But this would imply: Once the bot gets running
  #   continuously, it would deadlock itself by reacting on and replying to
  #   its own messages over and over again. Therefore, to avoid such, this
  #   method quits as soon as we realize we are about to talk to ourselves,

# sample code for a minimalist ÂµB bot of your own:
#
# bot = MicroBlogBot.new
# bot.say_hello
# bot.operate
# bot.shutdown
#
# for a more advanced one, extend sample-bot.rb


# todo:
# + create gem
#   + check gem in to the usual gems repository
#   + announce gem
# + present the framework at FrOSCon
# + if possible and useful, allow +block+s as values for the @bot_commands
#   hash, so developing own derivate bots would become dead-simple: Just
#   inherit your bot, then change the commands hash as you like.
#   + intensify parsing via inheritant
# + add tests for MicroBlogBot
# + Don't attempt to follow back any users whose accounts are under Twitter
#   investigation, such as @michellegggssee.
# + make sure that if users change their screen names, nothing is going to
#   break
# + learn to deal with errors like this: "in `handle_response!': Twitter is
#   returning a 400: Bad Request (Twitter::CantConnect)" -- which actually
#   can be (witnessed!) some fail whale thing at the other end, cf. commit
#   #10, which *looked* broken because of that error, though after getting a
#   new IP address, it was gone, ie. it indeed was a fail of Twitter, not of
#   the bot code.
# + read on that official Twitter/Identica documentation has to say on bots
# + read documentation of jnunemaker's Twitter gem/ask him whether or not
#   he'd like it if I'd contribute any
# + join forces with other ~Twitter bots' developers
# + delete old 'help' responses after a while, say a few days
# . summed up the lessons learned at: http://is.gd/j7T6
# . terminology questions: followee, tweed, Twitter-compatibility, reply
# . needed to patch underlaying Twitter gem
