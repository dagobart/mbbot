#   + announce gem
# + present the framework at FrOSCon
# + if possible and useful, allow +block+s as values for the @bot_commands
#   hash, so developing own derivate bots would become dead-simple: Just
#   inherit your bot, then change the commands hash as you like.
#   + intensify parsing via inheritant
# + add tests for MicroBlogBot
# + Don't attempt to follow back any users whose accounts are under Twitter
#   investigation, such as @michellegggssee.
# + make sure that if users change their screen names, nothing is going to
#   break
# + learn to deal with errors like this: "in `handle_response!': Twitter is
#   returning a 400: Bad Request (Twitter::CantConnect)" -- which actually
#   can be (witnessed!) some fail whale thing at the other end, cf. commit
#   #10, which *looked* broken because of that error, though after getting a
#   new IP address, it was gone, ie. it indeed was a fail of Twitter, not of
#   the bot code.
# + read on that official Twitter/Identica documentation has to say on bots
# + read documentation of jnunemaker's Twitter gem/ask him whether or not
#   he'd like it if I'd contribute any
# + join forces with other ~Twitter bots' developers
# + delete old 'help' responses after a while, say a few days
# . summed up the lessons learned at: http://is.gd/j7T6
